# What's this
* A repo which ~~is~~ ~~has~~ had been dedicated to exploit(?) GitHub Actions to build software without messing up my computer
* Local build now also possible using Docker *(Terms and conditions apply. Not all items provided are eligible.)*

# Why you made this
* It makes me not need to mess up my computer\
  *i mean i ain't gonna `apt-get install` shites which only get used once per OS reinstall*
* If that's not persuasive enough... Well it's free i guess? *(only applicable to GitHub Actions build, Data and Electricity rates may apply for Docker builds)*
